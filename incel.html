        <h1>Is the word "incel" considered derogatory?</h1>
        <p>Let's explore this matter.</p>

            Let’s take a look at the phrase "involuntary celibate". "Celibate" refers to a person who doesn't involve themselves in marriage and sexual relations. So, as you can guess, an "involuntary" celibate means it is out of their control that they remain celibate. Combining those two words creates "incel". However, an additional definition has emerged, which is that men who are unable to attract women often become misogynistic, blaming and objectifying women as a result.

            In my opinion, calling men this perpetuates negative stereotypes and not only is it harmful, but downright disrespectful. My friend, Yuhan, was labelled an incel, and here are his thoughts on the situation.

            "I was extremely hurt and frustrated by what those women called me. They were painting me as if I were someone who is bitter and hateful, which I am not at all. Not only did it not reflect who I truly was, but I also felt as if my humanity had been stripped away. This was largely due to the fact they were most likely cursing my character and livelihood while labelling me as an 'incel'."

        <p>Here is a brief overview of some of the conversation we had over on text:</p>
        
        <p>
            <b>The Women in Question:</b> "You are an incel, and you do incel activities."<br>
            <b>Me:</b> "What does incel even mean? Let me search it up."<br>
            <i>*I search up the definition*</i><br>
            <b>Me:</b> "Wow ok"<br>
            <b>The Women in Question:</b> "Do you resonate?"
        </p>

        <p>
            We were talking about some dodgy thing I did when I was young and stupid, but I reckon they were labelling me an incel just for the heck of it—perhaps for the thrill of insulting and making baseless accusations of someone they simply didn’t like. But I mean, seriously? "Do you resonate?" What kind of question is that? That’s purely just salt applied to the wound.

            But like, 5 minutes later, I did actually make a mistake that may have supported their outrageous claims. I referred to women as "females", and we’ll leave out the context, but it was nothing misogynistic. I genuinely did not know the term "females" was derogatory. I know it was obvious in hindsight, but at the time, I thought of it like it was simply a biological term. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In the context of biology, it is scientifically accurate as it’s a factual term referring to a person’s sex. But now, I can see how the term can be seen as dehumanizing, almost objectifying, as it reduces a woman to her biological sex and can come across as demeaning. It just didn’t make sense to me at the time because I wouldn’t be offended by women referring to men as "males". 
        </p>

        <p>
            I have to admit, big mistake on my part, and I had to dismiss it as "slang", but in truth, I just didn’t want to seem oblivious. As you can guess, THEY IMMEDIATELY CALLED ME OUT ON IT (rightfully so, but still...) AS IF YOU WEREN’T CALLING ME A DEROGATORY TERM JUST 5 MINUTES BEFORE? WHAT IS THIS DOUBLE STANDARD? The difference was that I genuinely did not know the implications of the word I was using, but they knew and deeply understood that the word "incel" was used to hurt—and it certainly did. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The women only focused on their emotions but never stopped to think about mine. And the fact that those same women continue to insult me and give dirty looks after this whole ordeal just makes me lose faith in humanity. Anyways, I digress.

        <p>
            Thank you, Yuhan, for this tear-jerking story. What frustrated me about his story was the hypocrisy in double standards. No, Yuhan, you did not digress. It’s good that you mentioned that. In fact, I might even take inspiration from it and make that the main topic of my next raindrop blog, so I won’t delve too much deeper into the matter. 
        </p>

            Going back on track, "incel" implies that all men who struggle with relationships are immediately just misogynistic all of a sudden. This harmful generalization fails to realize that some men do struggle when it comes to romance, which is nothing to be ashamed of. Calling someone an "incel" and making other toxic assumptions without understanding their situation is quite... Well, I’m not sure words can even describe it. You damage the person being labelled and society as a whole.
